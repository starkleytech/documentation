<hr />
<p>Welcome to the comprehensive guide on staking within the SwapDex and Kusari networks. Both networks utilize a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, where staking is a fundamental aspect. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-staking"><a class="header" href="#what-is-staking">What is Staking?</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Staking involves locking your SDX or KSI tokens for a specific purpose and duration to support network security and operations. In return, participants earn rewards. There are two primary ways to engage in staking:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nominating</strong>: Support validators by staking tokens.</li>
<li><strong>Validating</strong>: Run a node to participate in network consensus.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="roles-in-staking"><a class="header" href="#roles-in-staking">Roles in Staking</a></h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="validators"><a class="header" href="#validators">Validators</a></h3>
<p>Validators are responsible for creating new blocks and validating transactions. They are crucial to the network's security. Validators put their tokens at stake as collateral. </p>
<h4 id="rewards-for-validators"><a class="header" href="#rewards-for-validators">Rewards for Validators</a></h4>
<p>The network is designed to distribute rewards equally among all validators. However, validators can set a commission for their services. The remaining rewards are distributed proportionally among the nominators.</p>
<h3 id="nominators"><a class="header" href="#nominators">Nominators</a></h3>
<p>Nominators support validators by staking their tokens. They share in the rewards earned by validators.</p>
<h4 id="rewards-for-nominators"><a class="header" href="#rewards-for-nominators">Rewards for Nominators</a></h4>
<p>Rewards are distributed pro-rata among the nominators after deducting the validator's commission. This means that your share of the rewards will increase with the number of tokens you have staked.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-staking"><a class="header" href="#understanding-staking">Understanding Staking</a></h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="nomination-period"><a class="header" href="#nomination-period">Nomination Period</a></h3>
<p>Anyone can become a validator candidate. Nominators can vote for validator candidates they trust. At the beginning of each era, the network selects the highest nominated validator candidates as the active set for the next era.</p>
<h3 id="staking-rewards-distribution"><a class="header" href="#staking-rewards-distribution">Staking Rewards Distribution</a></h3>
<p>Rewards are distributed at the end of each era. Every validator pool receives essentially the same amount of tokens for equal work. However, each validator can set a customized commission. The rest is paid pro-rata to the nominators.</p>
<h3 id="slashing"><a class="header" href="#slashing">Slashing</a></h3>
<p>Slashing occurs if a validator fails to perform its duties or acts maliciously. Slashed tokens are usually added to the Treasury.</p>
<h2 id="accounts-for-staking"><a class="header" href="#accounts-for-staking">Accounts for Staking</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>For added security, it is recommended to create two types of accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stash Account</strong>: This is your cold wallet. It holds your funds and delegates certain functions to the controller account.</li>
<li><strong>Controller Account</strong>: This is your hot wallet. It acts on behalf of your stash account and is used for making decisions about nominating or validating.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="risks-and-mitigations"><a class="header" href="#risks-and-mitigations">Risks and Mitigations</a></h2>
<hr />
<h3 id="liveliness"><a class="header" href="#liveliness">Liveliness</a></h3>
<p>Validators must be online and responsive. If a validator is offline, it may be chilled (temporarily removed from the validator set) and won't receive block rewards.</p>
<h3 id="equivocation"><a class="header" href="#equivocation">Equivocation</a></h3>
<p>This occurs when a validator illicitly creates multiple blocks for the same slot. It is considered a serious offense and is punished by slashing.</p>
<h3 id="misconduct"><a class="header" href="#misconduct">Misconduct</a></h3>
<p>This includes behaviors that pose a security or monetary risk to the network. Misconduct is severely punished by slashing.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-mitigate-risks"><a class="header" href="#how-to-mitigate-risks">How to Mitigate Risks</a></h2>
<hr />
<ol>
<li><strong>Monitor Your Node</strong>: Use monitoring tools to keep track of your node's status.</li>
<li><strong>Secure Your Server</strong>: Ensure that your server is secure. Regularly update your software and protect your server with firewalls.</li>
<li><strong>Be Cautious with Validator Selection</strong>: If you are a nominator, choose validators with a good reputation and performance.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<hr />
<p>Staking is an essential component of the SwapDex and Kusari networks. It is crucial for network security and offers an opportunity to earn rewards. However, it comes with responsibilities and risks. Whether you choose to be a nominator or a validator, it is important to understand the mechanics of staking, monitor your investments, and take steps to mitigate risks.
``The above content is a more detailed and structured version of the information you provided. It covers the essentials of staking within the SwapDex and Kusari networks, including the roles of validators and nominators, how staking rewards are distributed, the concept of slashing, and the importance of security and risk mitigation. This format aims to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of staking for anyone interested in participating in the SwapDex or Kusari networks.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-mnemonic-phrase">What Is A Mnemonic Phrase?</a></h2>
<p>Mnemonic Phrases, also known as seed phrases or recovery phrases, are a sequence of 12 or 24 random words that provide the data needed to recover a lost or broken crypto wallet. By having this phrase, you can access all your cryptocurrencies within the wallet even if you lose or delete it. It's critical to keep your phrase words secure because anyone with possession of your seed phrase also has access and can authorize moving or selling your cryptocurrency. We highly recommend writing your seed phrase down on a physical piece of paper and storing it in a secure location that no one else can gain access to.</p>
<p>The seed phrase is the master key to your crypto funds in a wallet, and you are responsible for its safety. Seed phrases cannot be recovered. If you lose your phrase, you will not be able to access this crypto wallet again.</p>
<p>Crypto wallets are also chain-specific. SwapDEX is built with Substrate Technology, so you can use your existing substrate seed phrase with our network, or you can use your SwapDEX seed phrase with other Substrate-based chains. We also have an EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine). If you want to use that, you will need a seed phrase. If you use our web app instead of our native mobile app or desktop apps, you will need to have Metamask and Polkadot.js extensions with wallets set up. It is recommended to use our native apps.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-crypto-wallet"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-crypto-wallet">What is a crypto wallet?</a></h2>
<p>A crypto wallet is software or hardware that enables users to store and use their cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency has no tangible currency (no paper money) to place within a physical wallet or purse. Cryptocurrency exists on blockchains.</p>
<p>A crypto wallet provides visibility into how much cryptocurrency the user owns. A crypto wallet also enables users to send and receive cryptocurrency transactions and to connect to decentralized applications. For many users, a crypto wallet is the primary mechanism for managing cryptocurrency balances.</p>
<p>With SwapDEX, because we are a decentralized exchange, you will be using your wallet to connect with our chain to gain access to our decentralized exchanges and our marketplace through one of our apps. Unlike centralized exchanges, your crypto will not leave your wallet. Your crypto will always be in your possession. That's what makes SwapDEX so special.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-crypto-wallets"><a class="header" href="#types-of-crypto-wallets">Types of crypto wallets</a></h2>
<p>There are two main types of crypto wallets: hot wallets and cold wallets. The primary difference between them is their internet connectivity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hot wallets (web wallets, desktop/mobile wallets) are connected to the internet, making them more user-friendly but less secure. They are suitable for regular transactions and trading.</li>
<li>Cold wallets (paper wallets, hardware wallets) are stored offline, providing improved security by reducing the risk of online attacks. They are better suited for long-term holdings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hot wallets are more likely to be used by traders for regular transactions, and cold wallets are more suitable for long-term holdings. Hot wallets are simple to set up, and the funds are easy to access, making them convenient for trading. Cold wallets are hack-resistant, making cold storage suitable for holding crypto for longer periods of time. As a protection method, it's a good idea to only store a small percentage in hot wallets and larger amounts in cold storage.</p>
<h2 id="custodial-vs-noncustodial-wallets"><a class="header" href="#custodial-vs-noncustodial-wallets">Custodial vs. noncustodial wallets</a></h2>
<p>Crypto wallet types are either custodial or noncustodial. The fundamental difference between custodial and noncustodial wallets is control.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Custodial wallets are crypto wallets in which the custody is managed by a third party, typically a centralized cryptocurrency exchange. Custodial wallets are suitable for users who don't want to fuss too much with security and who are not concerned with trusting a third party to hold their crypto. However, it's generally not advised to keep large amounts of cryptocurrency in a custodial wallet due to potential risks like hacks or even the exchange going bankrupt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noncustodial wallets are crypto wallets where the custody is held by the individual who has the private keys for their crypto assets and is responsible for securing them. Noncustodial wallets don't require a user to trust a third party for account security, but they do require a substantial amount of self-trust. Remember, if a private key is lost or compromised, a user's funds can be drained or otherwise rendered irretrievable.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both custodial and noncustodial wallets have numerous benefits and potential disadvantages, depending on the type of wallet being used. However, there is a risk associated with both custodial and noncustodial types of wallets, with the greatest risk being the potential for theft, fraud, or cyber attacks.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h2 id="web-app"><a class="header" href="#web-app">Web App</a></h2>
